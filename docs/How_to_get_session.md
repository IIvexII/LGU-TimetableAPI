### FAQ

- Did Session ID Retrieve my identity?

  Ans: Arguably, no. Session is a unique identifier that a web server assigns to a user for the duration of the current session. (session: when users enter the password -> close the browser). Since password and username are the same, rare cases would be they implemented a mechanism to uniquely identify each session by IP.
